This is being done after freeze of 3.15

library(BiocBuildTools)

source("build_packageSet_3.15.R", echo=TRUE)

produces PackageSet_RELEASE_3_15.rds

looks like:

BiocBBSpack PackageSet instance.
 There are 2140 packages listed (Bioconductor version 3.15).
 There are 2382 unique dependencies listed.
 Branch name: RELEASE_3_15

The first thing we want to do is get the git sources
for all packages.  Use populate_local_gits with gitspath on a
large disk space.  In October 2022 we changed getpk
to clone with --depth 1.

library(BiocBuildTools)
myset = readRDS("PackageSet_RELEASE_3_15.rds")
populate_local_gits(myset, "/media/volume/sdb/vince/REL_315_srcs")

On oct 22 it took 33 minutes to check out all sources.

What is the purpose of having all the sources?  We can
program over them to learn about the ecosystem.  But we
don't necessarily need them for the next steps:

1) install all packages and declared dependencies as
non-redundantly as possible, with maximum parallelism

2) obtain results of R CMD check for all packages -- this
probably benefits from having the sources but I don't know
if it is essential.

Building process.

We could start from scratch but we will not do so.  BiocManager::install
can be used on the PackageSet instance pkgnames element with a 
high number of CPUs to get us to a fully installed state.  The check
phase might necessitate additional installations to get all required
dependencies.

Continuing with code above defining myset:

BiocManager::install(myset@pkgnames, Ncpus=40, dependencies=TRUE)
