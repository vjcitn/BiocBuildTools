This is being done after freeze of 3.15

It is crucial to use BiocManager for 3.15 to get accurate post mortem information --
why did certain packages fail to install?


This is being done after freeze of 3.15

You need devtools/remotes and vjcitn/BiocBuildTools and BiocPkgTools, use Ncpus large

library(BiocBuildTools)

source("build_packageset_3.15.R", echo=TRUE)

produces PackageSet_RELEASE_3_15.rds

looks like:


BiocBBSpack PackageSet instance.
 There are 2140 packages listed (Bioconductor version 3.15).
 There are 2379 unique dependencies listed.
 Branch name: RELEASE_3_15


The first thing we want to do is get the git sources
for all packages.  Use populate_local_gits with gitspath on a
large disk space.  In October 2022 we changed getpk
to clone with --depth 1.

library(BiocBuildTools)
myset = readRDS("PackageSet_RELEASE_3_15.rds")
populate_local_gits(myset, "/media/volume/sdb/vince/REL_315_srcs")

On oct 22 it took 33 minutes to check out all sources.

What is the purpose of having all the sources?  We can
program over them to learn about the ecosystem.  But we
don't necessarily need them for the next steps:

1) install all packages and declared dependencies as
non-redundantly as possible, with maximum parallelism

2) obtain results of R CMD check for all packages -- this
probably benefits from having the sources but I don't know
if it is essential. 

--

Building process.

We could start from scratch but we will not do so.  BiocManager::install
can be used on the PackageSet instance pkgnames element with a 
high number of CPUs to get us to a fully installed state.  The check
phase might necessitate additional installations to get all required
dependencies.

Continuing with code above defining myset:

BiocManager::install(myset@pkgnames, Ncpus=40, dependencies=TRUE)

It took around two hours to install 4100+ packages.

Some failed packages are not mentioned above.  We need to go deeper.

ABAEnrichment fails for lack of ABAData.  This could only be determined by attempting manual
install.  I don't know why it didn't get into the log.  Perhaps BiocManager can't attempt
installation, even though the package is in the manifest.

-- Here's a list of packages removed in 3.16:

Experiment Data Packages:

Workflow Packages:

---

Bottom line.  We can get reasonable "explanatory text" for a number of failed
installations, and the text often indicates that a CRAN dependency has gone missing.

Because packages can get back into CRAN, this leads to some effort on investigations of
failure that we'd like to automate.
