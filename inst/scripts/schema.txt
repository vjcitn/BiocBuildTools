Prepare ubuntu, especially latex

Bioc git branch (e.g., RELEASE_3_15)
-> manifest
-> PackageSet
-> add dependencies
-> populate_local_gits
-> BiocManager::install [ensure version coincides with git branch] 
      with large Ncpus to get functional R
-> iterate over git sources: safe_rcmdcheck, save each result
-> collect all check results, store in SQLite

Cadence of updates to database: periodic scan of repos, or github action on repo push?

Crucial step -- could be daily or hourly, but the task is to update the database

- platform-specific check/BiocCheck
- artifact BUILD_STATUS_db.txt can be generated from database
- must use xvfb-run
