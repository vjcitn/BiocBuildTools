\usage{
browse_checks(con, pnet_obj)

developer report on package check process in shiny
}
\note{
dbDisconnect is run if the stop button is pressed to end shiny session.  If
stopped via ctrl-C or error, the connection may remain and require closure.  N.B.  The
source codes for this app are in inst/app1, to simplify contribution to shinyapps.io.
Interactive execution proceeds by copying the server and ui files to temporary folder
where \code{shiny::runApp()} is executed.  For some packages for which tests do not succeed
coverage statistics derived by pkgnet will be absent.

\examples{
if (interactive()) {
 con = RSQLite::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), 
  system.file("sqlite/demo16.sqlite", package="BiocBuildTools"), flags=RSQLite::SQLITE_RO)
