Description: This package includes software and documentation related to
    creation and management of the Bioconductor software ecosystem.
    A pkgdown website and docker image are generated based on workflow 
    settings, to help interested developers explore aspects of
    software ecosystem definition and evolution.  This project was funded
    in part in the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative Essential Open Source
    Software program, SVCF Grant 183436.
